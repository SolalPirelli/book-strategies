# Introduction

Writing scientific papers is hard when it's done as an art. This guide is about viewing writing as _engineering_ rather than _art_. My background is in the "systems" field of computer science, though the core ideas are applicable beyond this.

Instead of giving vague advice on what to strive for, this guide tells you how to structure your papers, what to use and not use when writing, and how this helps your workflow. It concludes with my personal opinion on what category of tools to use, though the guide is tool-agnostic.

Limiting your choices when writing will make your papers better because you will spend more time on the core task of writing and less time wondering how to structure sections, where to cut or add text, and other non-core tasks. The resulting paper will be better than most attempts at the art of writing, even if inferior to what an expert artist-writer could theoretically achieve.

This is similar to the notion of type systems in programming languages: a good type system prevents programmers from making entire classes of mistakes, even if it also occasionally prevents them from writing code in the exact way they want to.

This guide was inspired by various things I have read, particularly[ Simon Peyton Jones's "How to write a great research paper"](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/). The four-sentence abstract structure is from [John Wilkes](https://john.e-wilkes.com/). [Larry McEnerney's "The Craft of Writing Effectively"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM) lecture is a great introduction to how academic writing differs from how you were writing in school.
