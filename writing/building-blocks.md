# Text

Your paper's sections, paragraphs, and sentences must be easily understandable by readers. While writing is hard in general, limiting yourself to simple and precise structuring, phrasing, and language makes the task considerably easier.

**Omit optional text**. Your paper's length is likely limited, and your readers' attention span definitely is. If a piece of text is not necessary, remove it. This means no footnotes and no text within parentheses or em dashes.

**Use simple structuring**. Your paper's structure must be obvious to readers, without asking them to remember complex structuring rules. Each section has a header, and contains groups of paragraphs. Each group's first paragraph starts with a bolded sentence summarizing the entire group. Do not use numbered sub-sections or even sub-sub-sections. Do not use multiple kinds of grouping such as bullet lists or italicized first sentences. Do not use "forward references", that is, do not refer to sections that the reader has not read yet, except for the section summaries in the introduction. Avoid referring to non-textual elements that are not on the current page, such as figures or tables.

**Use simple phrasing**. Your paper must be concise, regardless of how uninspiring it is from a linguistical perspective. If you have multiple similar points to make, use the same phrasing for all of them. If you must refer to the same concept multiple times, use the same word. If you use bracketed reference numbers, your text should still make sense without them. If you write a sentence that makes more than one point, split it in two.

**Use precise phrasing**. Your paper must be as clear as possible. All actions should have a clear subject and object. Do not use the passive voice to avoid mentioning a subject. Do not give agency to inanimate objects, such as claiming a figure "shows" something, to avoid mentioning an argument's origin.

**Use simple language**. Your paper will be read by people from all over the world, who may not know the same complex words or historical references as you do. Do not use long and fancy words such as "utilize" instead of "use". Do not use expressions in dead languages or metaphors from a mythology you happened to study in elementary school. Do not try to be clever with plurals such as "data" or "fora". Do not use overly informal language.

**Use precise language**. Your paper must be as unambiguous as possible. Your readers may misunderstand poorly-phrased claims or even disbelieve overly-hyped ones. Do not use [weasel words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word) such as "appears to" or "somewhat". Do not use grandiose statements such as "far from trivial" or "there is no doubt". Do not use vague qualifiers such as "very" or "much". Understand the differences between word pairs such as "complex"/"complicated" and "enable"/"allow".

**Use correct punctuation**. Your paper must be easy to follow. Using punctuation incorrectly leads to overly long sentences and odd layout. Avoid semicolons in general, they can be replaced by a period to make two reasonably-sized sentences. Make sure you use a non-breaking space between characters that must stay together, such as \(1\) inline list numbers and text, and \(2\) text and \[bracketed references\].
