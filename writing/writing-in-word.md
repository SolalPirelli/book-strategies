# Workflow

Scientists do not write papers in a vacuum, but in the context of a publication, with deadlines and co-authors. Planning the structure ahead of time and getting early feedback are key to writing a good paper.

**Write early drafts for feedback**. Do this even before you have any results. Your earliest drafts will look like brain dumps, and that's fine. Writing down your thoughts before doing research allows you to check with yourself and with colleagues that what you want to do makes sense. Writing while doing research allows you to get feedback on whether your results are convincing and useful. When the time comes to write the actual paper, you will spend less time wondering what to write and you will need fewer feedback rounds.

**Write sections in units of pages**. Just as page limits for papers force you to write a concise paper, limiting your sections forces you to write concise sections. Break down your paper into sections and define how many pages each section will take at the start. Then, write each section independently, finishing a version of one section before working on another. The section limits do not have to be set in stone, as you may discover along the way that they need to change, but this change needs to be a conscious decision.

Using pages as the atomic unit ensures that you will never have to decide which section to cut to make the paper fit its overall length limit. By design, the paper will fit once all sections fit within their limit. Thus, decisions about cutting are localized to sections, which are easier to fit entirely in one's mind.

Using pages as the atomic unit also makes feedback easier to give and more valuable to receive. You can send a specific section to a colleague for feedback early on, since you are writing sections independently, instead of making them wait for a "clean" draft of the entire paper. The feedback you receive will be more useful, since the section is closer to its final form in terms of content than an intermediate draft of an entire paper would be. There is less risk of wasting your colleagues' time with feedback that goes unused because the section changed significantly due to length constraints.

To write page-long sections effectively, use absolute constraints as much as possible. Add page breaks between each section, and put figures and other non-textual elements at absolute locations in their corresponding section, such as aligned to the top-right of a page's margin. This ensures that the layout of a section is only affected by the section itself, instead of depending on all other sections.

**Write a news report from the future first**, which is the abstract and introduction you would like to have. Use the same format and length as the final version: four sentences for the abstract, then one paragraph of summary per section, then one paragraph with the contributions. Check with yourself and with colleagues that this paper structure makes sense. When writing the sections later, use these summaries as rough drafts.

Once the rest of the paper is finished, rewrite the abstract and introduction to match what the rest of the paper really says, especially around your hypotheses, claims, and results.
