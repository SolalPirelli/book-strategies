# Recording with PowerPoint

PowerPoint for Windows has awesome recording tools, but they're hidden by default; here's a quick intro.

First, go to _File &gt; Options &gt; Customize Ribbon_ and enable _Recording_ in the right-hand pane.  
You now have a Recording tab in the ribbon, with a _Record Slide Show_ button.  
Click that button and you'll be dropped into the recording interface.

## Key ideas

**Let viewers know who they're listening to, but don't overwhelm them.**  
Your face on each slide is both a distraction to viewers and an annoyance when recording, since all video recordings need to be consistent. However, having no face at all makes viewers feel weird. A good middle ground is to start and end with video segments, either full-screen or taking a decent fraction of the slide, much more than PowerPoint's default. All other slides should be voice only.

**Design your presentation to hide recording cuts.**  
You'll never get any work done if you try to record the entire presentation in one shot with no mistakes. Instead, make it easy for you to redo any given slide as many times as needed. Each slide should be self-contained. This is also useful when getting feedback, since you'll likely only have to re-record some slides, which saves lots of time.

**Use notes, don't improvise.**  
Improvisation is for designing your slides. Once you know what you want to say, write it down in the notes, and read from those when recording. Make sure to write notes in a "spoken" dialect, and to read them as if you were speaking without notes; don't bore viewers by reading a formal text in a monotone voice.

> â„¹ As of this writing, the _Notes_ pane in the recording interface cannot be resized, so you may have to scroll it while reading, which can be a little tricky.

## Details

PowerPoint audio and video recordings work like any other object: they have associated animations, they have a size, and so on. You can for instance move and resize the recorded video.

Recordings also include animation and transition timings. You can thus make minor edits to slides and their animations, such as changing a color, without having to record the slide again.

You may need to manually sync some updates to maintain consistency. For instance, if you trim a video you should also reduce the transition time of the slide to match.

When recording a single slide, use Esc to stop; if you go to the next slide instead, you'll overwrite whatever was recorded there. If you're recording your videos first and doing the audio-only slides later, add a blank slide before the end slide with a video, it'll ensure you don't accidentally overwrite the video.

To export slides that include recordings, clear the recordings, export the slides, then undo.

If your mouse makes a loud click sound, use the right keyboard arrow to move forward instead.
